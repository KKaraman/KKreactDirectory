## User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

## Functionality
- Sort the table by at least one category
- Filter the users by at least one property.
